# Forecasting-Financial-Inclusion
This repository contains an end-to-end data science project focused on forecasting Ethiopia’s financial inclusion trajectory using the World Bank Global Findex framework. The project was developed as part of the 10 Academy – KAIM Artificial Intelligence Mastery (Week 10 Challenge). 

## Task 1: Data Understanding and Enrichment

### Objective
The objective of Task 1 is to understand, validate, and enhance Ethiopia’s
financial inclusion dataset in preparation for analytical modeling.

### Key Activities
- Loaded and validated observations, events, and target indicators
- Reviewed schema consistency and data completeness
- Performed exploratory summaries by pillar, confidence, and time coverage
- Identified key data gaps limiting time-series analysis
- Added enriched proxy observations to improve modeling feasibility
- Documented all enrichment decisions for transparency and auditability

### Outputs
- Enriched dataset saved to `data/processed/ethiopia_fi_unified_data_enriched.csv`
- Data enrichment documentation in `data/enrichment/data_enrichment_log.md`
- Clean and reproducible Task 1 notebook

### Notes
Original raw data remains unchanged. All additions are conservative estimates
used solely to support downstream analysis and forecasting tasks.
